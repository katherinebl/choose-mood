# choose-mood

This is an exercise to practice Javascript.

You can choose between two moods: happy :) and sad :(

When you click "update" button, the mood you choose will be updated and the theme color will change according to random numbers, that is: there's a function that generates random numbers between 0 and 100. If the random number is even the theme shows a yellow color and if the random number is not even, the theme color will be green.

Any sugetions?
